# Item_based_collaborative_filtering

In this project we have developed an item based collaborative recommendation system. We have used the movielens dataset. 

To determine similar movies, we have used the following algorithms:
- K-nearest neighbours (KNN).
- Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with cosine similarity.
- LSH with Jaccard similarity.


In Evaluation.ipynb we have benchmarked the three algoritm based on
- RMSE on the rating prediction.
- Execution time.
